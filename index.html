        <h2>What is Antarctica and where it lies?</h2>
        <p>Now thats not a most asked question but it is a question and I have to answer it, so all of you who know what's Antarctica Good, For all those who don't know what's Antarctica, It is an continent which lies on Southern Atlantic Ocean on the South Pole and it does not have any piece of land/country near it, it is also known as the coldest place on the whole planet Earth with having tempreature below -50°C for most of the time. So now I think you know about what is Antarctica and where it lies so lets move on.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What is the climate like in Antarctica and why is it like that?</h2>

        <embed src="https://giphy.com/embed/UI1LUP61p3YYM">
        <p>The landscape in Antarctica is just pure snow and a funfact Antarctica has been melted more than half in the water since it was first seen.</p>
        <h2>How is the wildlife,ecosystems and food webs in Antarctica?</h2>
        <p>So first lets divide this into 2 parts and Now it is easier to read information(and easier to put information)</p>
        <br><h3>Wildlife - </h3> <p>The Wildlife in Antarctica is just animals that can survive high winds, ice and snow like penguins, seals, etc. Cause in a place were the tempreature is always below -50°C, like who expects a lion to survive in that atmosphere.</p> <br><h3>Eco-System and Food Web - </h3><p>First of all there are no trees in antarctica at all and by at all I mean at all so animals do not get food from the land they get it from water like seals, penguins and some other winter birds eat fishes, and fishes eat other small fishes and small fishes eat water plants such as corals, etc.</p><br>
        <h2>How was Antarctica discovered?</h2>
        <embed src="https://giphy.com/embed/pzdFxSjxXbcJmKrdop">
        <p>Antarctica was discovered on 27 January 1820, a Russian expedition led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev discovered an ice shelf at Princess Martha Coast that later became known as the Fimbul Ice Shelf.</p>
        <h2>Is Antarctica important for scientific purposes?</h2>
        <embed src="https://giphy.com/embed/FXk7Ba6J66KhPXgZKE">
        <p>Antarctica is really important for scientific purposes referring to these three points<br>1. To Research Why can't other polar animals survive in Antarctica and this is not just because of coldness of Antarctica, it has more and more details which scientists are figuring out.<br>2. To study Icebergs.<br>3. To invetigate how does science adapt to extreme weather conditions</p>
        <h2>Is there any tourism in Antarctica and What are the imapacts of this?</h2>
        <embed src="https://giphy.com/embed/KGwTZd1qr8hsSKsrFI">
        <p>Yep There is tourism in Antarctica like there are 1,000 to 5,000 people seasonally. it has many major harmful impacts one of them is listed here :- Accidental introduction of foreign invasive species like insects or seeds through clothes and boots on this unspoiled land.</p>
        <h2>How is Antarctica Governed?</h2>
        <p> The Antarctica was first governed by the UK which was the first of twelve countries to sign the Antarctic Treaty in 1959. The other eleven were: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, USA and the former Soviet Union. In 2023 There are no countries governing it.</p>
